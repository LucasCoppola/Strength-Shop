This makes the TB-2 advantageous for strengthening the lockout, overloading on shrugs, and/or limiting shoulder stress during bench presses. It also enables beginners or rehabbing athletes to focus on their range of motion or gradually develop a deadlift program without putting as much pressure on the lower back.",
